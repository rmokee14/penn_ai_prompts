# Task 

You are creating discharge instructions for a patient after they are leaving the hospital.

# Instructions to Follow

- Write at level of 6-grade reading level
- Explain any jargon in a succinct way
- Only include medications in the "NEW MEDICATIONS" section that the patient was not before in the outpatient setting, and is now starting. This almost never includes things like lovenox or heparin for prophylaxis.
- Only include medications in the "MEDICATIONS TO STOP" section that the patient was taking before in the outpatient setting and is now stopping. 
- Briefly explain what each new medication is treating or why they are taking it.
- You can use judgement on what else important from the inputs should be called out and highlighted in its own section - common things include diet restrictions, activity restrictions, wound/ostomy care, etc. Be specific to the patient and avoid generalities.
- The "Please call your doctor, call 911, or return to the emergency department if" instructions should all be on one line, not bullets.
- The headings "New Medications", "Medication Dosage Change", "Medications to STOP", and "Follow Up With" should all be underlined as well as bolded.

# Example

Mr. Smith,

You were admitted to the hospital with a urinary tract infection (pseudomonas), atrial flutter/fibrillation with rapid heart rate, and fluid overload.

While in the hospital, you were treated with antibiotics for your urinary tract infection (cefepime - we are done with this), given diuretics to remove excess fluid, and your heart rhythm medications were adjusted. You converted back to normal heart rhythm. A small wound on your lower back was evaluated and wound care recommendations were provided. 

Your weight the day of discharge was 170.6 lbs (77.57 kg)

---

**New Medications:**
- **Bumetanide** 0.5mg by mouth once daily (water pill to prevent fluid buildup). If your leg swelling worsens, take two tablets daily instead of one
- **Valsartan** 20mg by mouth once daily (heart and blood pressure medication)
- **Metoprolol** succinate ER 75mg by mouth once daily (increased from your previous dose of 50mg - you can take three 25 mg tablets)

**Medications to STOP:**
- **Hydralazine** 
- **Isosorbide mononitrate** 

**Please continue taking your other medications as before.**

---

**Follow Up With:**
- VA Cardiology within 1 week to review medication changes and check blood work (potassium and kidney function)
- Blood draw by end of this week or early next week for CBC (blood count) and BMP (electrolytes and kidney function)
- Interventional Radiology on (date) for kidney tube exchange
- Your oncology team will reschedule your port placement; you are also due for your next round of chemo on 12/17

---

**Wound Care for Lower Back:**
- Turn to your side and change position every two hours
- Clean the wound with warm mild soap and water, then rinse and dry
- Cover with Allevyn life foam dressing 5x5 inches
- Change dressing every three days unless soiled

**Important Fluid Restriction:**
- Limit your daily fluid intake to no more than 2 liters (about 8 cups) per day to avoid fluid overload given your kidney disease and heart failure

---

Please call your doctor, call 911, or return to the emergency department if you develop worsening leg swelling, shortness of breath, chest pain, rapid heart rate, fever, worsening wound drainage or redness, or any other concerning symptoms.

It was a pleasure taking care of you!
