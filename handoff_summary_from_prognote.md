# Instructions 

Using only information in the progress note input, generate the following:

1. Begin with a typical “one-liner” using the following formatting: “40M with T2DM, CAD (s/p PCI 2016), HFrEF (last EF 35% from 08/2025), who presented with sternal chest pain, admitted for NSTEMI.
2. Follow this with a brief summary of the patient’s hospitalization to date. This should be linear and easy to follow, highlighting management, progress, complications, the most up to date/relevant data, and current patient status.
3. List any relevant data from the hospitalization, highlighting the most recent labs and imaging or relevance. 
4. A list of the most important (3-5) problems that the patient is currently being treated for in the hospital, and what the most up to date plan is. Like problems should be lumped together. This should resemble a focused but complete plan, and suggest possible next steps. The final problem should be "Chronic" and should have one single line for each chronic disease's plan while inpatient.
5. Highlight what still needs to be done for the patient to safely be discharged from the hospital. Avoid generalities and be specific to the patient's hospitalization.
6. Suggest any additional management options that have not been discussed/considered by previous team, and/or additional questions/history that may be worth clarifying.

- Include the most up to date and relevant laboratory and imaging data.
- Be specific with medication dosing and durations plans.
- Use common medical abbreviations and shorthand.

# Example: 

26F with sickle cell anemia (HgbSS, c/b acute chest syndrome, AVN s/p bilateral total hip arthroplasties) and asthma, admitted for VOC.

Patient was admitted three days ago on 1/10/2026 with a VOC, presenting with severe pain and hypoxia. 
She received two units of PRBCs for acute on chronic anemia, with a good hematologic response. Her most recent Hgb was 9.1 on 1/13/2026. 
Pain management has been challenging: her PCA dilaudid basal was stopped on 1/12, but due to inadequate pain control and return of severe pain, the basal was restarted at a lower dose per hematology recommendations. She is currently on a dilaudid PCA at 0.2 basal, 0.8 demand, q20 minutes. She continues on home morphine ER 15mg q12, with increased morphine IR 45mg q4 PRN (home dosing is 30mg) and toradol 30mg q6. She has refused ketamine and further increases in morphine IR, and has been insistent on IV diphenhydramine, which has been avoided due to risk of delirium and sedation. 
Opioid-induced pruritus is being managed with a naloxone infusion, loratadine, famotidine, and as-needed oral antihistamines. 
She remains clinically stable, without respiratory distress, but is upset and tearful due to ongoing pain and pruritus. Labs show improved hemoglobin post-transfusion, persistent mild hypoxia, and stable vital signs. Imaging has not shown acute pulmonary embolism.


Relevant Data: 
- Hgb on admission 6.0 --> Hgb 1/13/2026 9.1
- Tbili 5.9 in the setting of VOC
- CTPE study from admission without PE or other acute pulmonary disease


Currently, patient is being treated for:

Sickle cell VOC Pain Crisis
- Continue PCA dilaudid 0.2mg basal, 0.8mg demand, q20 minutes - plan to wean to q30 as able
- Continue home morphine ER 15mg q12 and IR 45mg q6 PRN
- Continue toradol 30mg q6 standing

Opioid-induced pruritus
- Continue Naloxone infusion (with titration as needed)
- Continue loratadine, famotidine, prn oral diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine (alternating)
- Avoidance of IV diphenhydramine per protoocl

Acute on chronic anemia
s/p 2 units PRBCs, with good response
- continue daily CBC with goal hgb > 6

Hypoxia
- trend with goal O2 > 92%

Chronic
- Asthma - continue albuterol PRN, montelukast 10mg daily
- Allergies - continue PRN anti-histmaines, as above
- HTN - continue amlodipine 5mg daily


To safely discharge the patient, the following need to be addressed:
- Achieve adequate and sustainable pain control on an oral regimen.
- Ensure pruritus is controlled with a safe, outpatient-appropriate regimen.
- Confirm stable hemoglobin and no new complications.
- Patient education and agreement on discharge medications and follow-up plan.
