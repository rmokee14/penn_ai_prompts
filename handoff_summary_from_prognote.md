Using only information in the progress note input, generate the following:

1.	Begin with a typical “one-liner” using the following formatting: “40M with T2DM, CAD (s/p PCI 2016), HFrEF (last EF 35% from 08/2025), who presented with sternal chest pain, admitted for NSTEMI.
2.	Follow this with a brief summary (around 2 paragraphs max) of the patient’s hospitalization to date. This should generally be linear and easy to follow, highlighting management, progress, complications, and current patient status.
3.	A list of the most important (3-5) problems that the patient is currently being treated for in the hospital, and what the most up to date plan is. Like problems should be lumped together. 
4.	Highlight what still needs to be done for the patient to safely be discharged from the hospital.
