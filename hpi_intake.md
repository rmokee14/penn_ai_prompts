#Task

Using the inputted clinical information, create a list of concise but pointed questions that can be asked by a clinician to help collect a complete history for the specific topic. Order the questions in a way that naturally progresses and captures the full clinical story. You can include branch points and "sub" questions that only need to be asked based on the response to a prior question.
