# Task
You are generating a handoff for an attending hospitalist who is taking over the care of an admitted patient. You will be given the most recent progress note, and you will generate the handoff.

# Instructions
- Use common medical abbreviations and shorthand that a generalist would know; write out less commonly known acronyms
- The medical "one-liner" should include relevant information for each problem in parentheses
- Dates should be in Month/Day/Year format (2/12/2024, 3/26/2025, 7/4/2025, etc). Only include the year if it is relevant
- Be very brief and focused with the output
- The Brief Hx section should be a brief paragrpah with ONLY the relevant PMH, presenting symptoms, what they have been diagnosed with, and how they are currently being treated. The flow should be easy to concise and easy to follow. Only include PMH that is relevant to the main inpatient problems/diagnoses. Do not list all medications the patient is taking, but rather only those important for the handoff. If mentioning a medication, include the dosing.
- The "Workup notable for" section should list the most important labs and imaging that have helped secure a diagnosis. Only include pertinent positive or negative findings, not those that are irrelevantly normal. Note any important trends or improvements in data (leukocytosis/WBC in sepsis, creatinine in AKI, Hgb in GI bleed, etc). You do NOT have to include information if it is clinically meaningless simply to include it. It's okay to not have anything in this section.
- The "Remains in hospital due to" section should list the MAIN barrier(s) to discharge that are specific to this patient. Put this in bullets - only include the THREE MOST IMPORTANT ongoing problems that need to be addressed, and state them clearly. You can include fewever than three when appropriate. Avoid generalities that apply to all patients.
- The "Next steps" section should list in bullets the major elements of the plan between now and safe discharge of the patient. Limit to the 3-5 MOST IMPORTANT next steps. You can have fewer than 3 if appropriate. Focus on the hospital problems and not chronic problems unless they are relevant to the hospitalization or discharge. Only mention needed outpatient follow up as it relates to the main hospital problems. Avoid simple platitudes like "bowel regimen", "wean pain meds", "Daily CBC and BMP", "replete lytes", "DVT ppx", "discharge planning", "continue supportive care", "monitor for clinical improvmenet", etc and instead have it be focused and specific to the patient, or not included at all.
- The "Situational Awareness" section is largely filled out by the attending after the fact and includes info that is not commonly part of the progress note (interpersonal dynamics, family, etc). However, if there is any relevant information included in the input that is important to know about the patient to best care for them or safelty discharge the patient, include it here. Otherwise, leave this section blank.

# Example

**Brief Hx:** 35M with sickle cell disease (c/b prior ACS, priapism, pHTN, ischemic stroke with exrpessive aphasia; on apheresis Q3 weeks via port), L ICA aneurysm s/p flow diverter (DATE), sarcoidosis (not on treatment), prior MRSA bacteremia, presented with VOC found to have MRSA bacteremia. Patient is now s/p port removal with IR on (DATE). He had an aspirate of fluid over prior port site that was sterile. He developed AKI 2/2 ATN from vancomycin, sepsis, and NSAID use - this is now improving with autodiuresis. He is currently on daptomycin daily. He was treated for VOC with oral/IV medication, and is now uptitrating suboxone which will be completed [DATE]. He was given 1u pRBC [DATE] given he was due for exchange transfusion. He is pending DC to SNF early next week after PICC placement.

**Workup notable for:** 
- BCx positive for MRSA on [DATE]. BCx cleared on [DATE].
- TTE on [DATE] did not show e/o endocarditis.
- MRI lumbar spine 1/24 did not show any evidence of infection.
- Patient's most recent Hgb 7.4 from 5.5 (after 1u pRBC), Cr 3.24 from peak 5.8 on [DATE].

**Remains in hospital due to:**
- AKI 2/2 ATN - Patient needs evidence of full renal recovery.
- MRSA Bacteremia on Daptomycin - patient will need PICC placed prior to DC.
- Pending DC to SNF (patient is unable to care for line and have PHIT come to home) - referrals have not been sent yet.

**Next Steps:** 
- Await renal recovery after ATN
- Continue to titrate up suboxone and space out opioid agonists
- PICC placement early next week
- Follow up CM/SW to discuss referrals

**Situational awareness:**
